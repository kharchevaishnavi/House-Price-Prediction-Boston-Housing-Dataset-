House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning regression techniques.  

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to predict the *median value of houses (MEDV)* based on different features such as crime rate, number of rooms, accessibility to highways, etc.

This project demonstrates:
- Data preprocessing
- Model training
- Model evaluation
- Prediction output
